Holi is a joyful celebration marked by people throwing colored powders and water at each other, signifying the arrival of spring. Muslims in India celebrate Eid-ul-Fitr and Eid-ul-Adha with prayers, feasts, and gift exchanges. Durga Puja is a major Hindu festival in West Bengal, honoring the goddess Durga and featuring elaborate decorations, cultural performances, and processions. Christmas, celebrated by Christians and non-Christians alike, is a time of joy and togetherness with decorated trees, midnight masses, and gift exchanges. Overall, India's festivals showcase the country's rich cultural heritage and diversity.\""
